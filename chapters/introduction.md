# Introduction

## About the application

The Risk Flow application was created primarily to facilitate the work of all risk managers and analysts. Your time is too valuable to waste on formatting tables or headings. Nor should you waste your time on thankless copying of information between different documents. Risk Flow offers you the opportunity to focus only on the content. It takes care of formatting and checking for correct data entry for you. It also takes care of keeping track of defined deadlines. It emphasizes teamwork and the possibility of multiple people working on the same project or parts of it. Your clients will be able to view and participate in the analyses being performed. In addition to inappropriate methods, Risk Flow eliminates the unsecured sharing of files and documents needed to complete risk analyses. Increase the efficiency of your work and your employees and perform risk analyses and asset management simply and, most importantly, securely.

## Main functionalities

User management will provide you with a clear and intuitive environment for managing access and permissions of users who will have access to the platform. In Client Management, you can enter and edit your clients and assign users to them. You can then create asset lists and create risk analyses for registered clients. Completed risk analyses are followed by a creation of a risk treatment plan. As part of approval processes, clients then review risk analyses, prepared plans and other documents and add their comments to them. Until the client approves all flow parts, you as risk managers and analysts are still able to modify them. Audit and control activities are a very important part of a properly set up risk management. Within Risk Flow, you can manage the access of internal and external auditors and perform audit processes.
